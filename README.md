## Recommendations

### Project Structure

`@`

The @ symbol points to the `src` folder

`src/pages`

- These are what you would typically import in your `routes.js` file
- File names should follow this convention : `Page<name-of-the-page>`. eg. `PageAbout, PageHome, PageProfile`

`src/components`

- All shared components live under this folder.
- Components are usually imported in `Pages` to constitute a full page

`src/components/commmon`

- Sometimes components can share sub components, these can live in the common folder.
- Files from common should not be imported directly into `Pages`
